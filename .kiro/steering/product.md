LyricLens is a web application that transforms audio files into visual experiences. Users upload songs, and the app:

1. Transcribes lyrics to SRT subtitle format using Gemini AI
2. Generates a visual storyboard with AI-created artwork based on lyric themes
3. Provides a synchronized karaoke-style player with waveform visualization
4. Supports translation of lyrics to multiple languages
5. Enables video export with generated visuals

The target users are content creators, musicians, and anyone wanting to create visual accompaniments for music.
