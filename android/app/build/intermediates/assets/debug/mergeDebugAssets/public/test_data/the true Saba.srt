1
00:00:51,539 --> 00:00:57,289
Oh, you who trick the soul with hopes that fade,

2
00:00:58,709 --> 00:01:04,019
this world is but a shadow and a shade.

3
00:01:05,489 --> 00:01:11,549
You weep for life, yet deep inside you know,

4
00:01:12,659 --> 00:01:16,879
the only peace is found in letting go.

5
00:01:19,439 --> 00:01:24,209
The days are travelers that will not stay.

6
00:01:26,389 --> 00:01:31,459
And happiness is walking a different way.

7
00:01:32,499 --> 00:01:37,709
There is no home awaiting after death,

8
00:01:39,369 --> 00:01:44,489
except the one you built with living breath.

9
00:01:45,959 --> 00:01:51,289
If built with good, a palace you shall find.

10
00:01:52,659 --> 00:01:57,809
If built with sin, you leave all hope behind.

11
00:02:03,819 --> 00:02:10,319
So work for the home where angels guard the gate.

12
00:02:10,819 --> 00:02:16,619
Where the prophet is the neighbor and the rewards are great.

13
00:02:17,769 --> 00:02:23,909
The walls are made of gold, the mortar smells of musk.

14
00:02:24,679 --> 00:02:28,849
A life that never fades into the dusk.

15
00:02:49,439 --> 00:02:54,779
Where are the kings, where is their royal throne?

16
00:02:56,089 --> 00:03:00,819
Where is the glory that the past has known?

17
00:03:03,349 --> 00:03:08,899
How many cities rose beneath the skies,

18
00:03:09,929 --> 00:03:15,009
only to crumble, wither and die?

19
00:03:16,459 --> 00:03:21,069
The cupbearer of death came to their halt,

20
00:03:22,469 --> 00:03:28,689
and poured the wine that ends it for us all.

21
00:03:28,689 --> 00:03:34,519
And now the sands have covered every storm.

22
00:03:36,49 --> 00:03:40,799
The high and low are buried and alone.

23
00:03:42,509 --> 00:03:48,399
Do not trust time, the seconds cut like knives.

24
00:03:50,479 --> 00:03:54,929
A single blink can swallow up our lives.

25
04:04,509 --> 04:08,589
True nobility is not in gold or birth,

26
04:11,109 --> 04:15,199
but in the faith you carry on this earth.

27
04:17,869 --> 04:23,439
Generosity comes first, patience is the key.

28
04:24,549 --> 04:28,759
A single prayer can set the spirit free.

29
04:58,899 --> 05:04,999
So work for the home where angels guard the gate.

30
05:05,429 --> 05:11,179
Where the prophet is the neighbor and the rewards are great.

31
05:12,479 --> 05:18,509
Its rivers flow with honey and with wine,

32
05:19,269 --> 05:23,809
for those who seek the mercy of the divine.

33
05:26,989 --> 05:32,239
This is the garden, eternal and green.

34
05:33,489 --> 05:37,739
The greatest sight the eyes have ever seen.

35
05:40,789 --> 05:45,999
And yet my soul will struggle to the end.

36
06:04,919 --> 06:10,879
I only find the path when I refuse to be my passion's friend.
